# the project
the aim of this project is to be a mod that allows virtual truckers in Euro Truck Simulator 2 (and possibly American Truck in the future) to share their stats, their shipment and route with others and to rank them based on a point based system. for this porpouse there will be a server side code that take the data sent by the clients and it will rank them automatically. the user will be able to use the official site for ranking or create his own using the server side code.
# privacy
the client will send just the needed stuff to the server: no password, no OS system and no personal data will be required.
